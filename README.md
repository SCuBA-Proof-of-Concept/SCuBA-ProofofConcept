This is a proof of concept for importing the SCuBA Gear tool into Azure executing the tool as a managed identity. Currently, the Entra ID (AAD) baselines were the only services incorporated into the tool. Again, with this being a proof of concept, it is not for production environments or to be utilized as a substitute for the actual SCuBA-Gear tool.
